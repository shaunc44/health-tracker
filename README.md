## HEALTH TRACKER  
#### *UDACITY - FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPER NANODEGREE*  
##### PROJECT 5-2  
In this project I designed a website that tracks the calories of  
various foods and beverages entered into the search bar and then  
selected from the search results list. The site then  
tabulates total calories of all foods or drinks entered.  

=================================================================


### INSTRUCTIONS  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
##### SEARCH BAR:  

	Enter any food and click "Search". Be sure that it's spelled  
	correctly or you may prompt an error.  

##### SEARCH RESULTS:  

	In the food results, click the food that you want to add to  
	your running total on the right-hand side of the screen where  
	it says, "Selected Food".  

##### TOTAL CALORIES:  

	This section shows the caloric total of all foods selected.  

##### FOOD NAME / CALORIES:  

	This section displays the most recent food selected from the  
	search results (left-hand side of the screen).  

##### ADD FOOD BUTTON:  

	Click the ADD FOOD button to move the selected food's calories  
	to your running total.  

##### SELECTED FOOD:  

	Here you will find the list of all of the foods you have  
	selected. To delete a food, click the red "X" to the right  
	of each food's caloric number.
